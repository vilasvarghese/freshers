Difference
----------

1. Keeps self in users shoes 
	beyond coding
2. First understands the feature from users perspective
	before jumping into development
3. Comes up with pain points 
	OR features which pops up in their mind and discusses them with team (specially product manager)
	Analyze better value for customers.
4. Cares equally about user experience 
	as he/she is into technology behind the product
5. Understands the users need and business plan of employer 
	AND convinces team to have a balance
6. More confident and opinonated - Believes in healthy discussions 
	and never keeps heavy heart
7. Becomes the Change agent
	Instead of complaining [about say architecture]; He/She understands why did they do and improves on with time
8. Works on communication skills

Requirement from Customer: I need a banking solution. I need to transact.
	Let the students do this.
	What would be the various listing pages?
	What would be the reports available to management?
	Identify the Non-Functional requirements which they missed.
	Think through and re-design.
	What if this was a product and not for a single bank? Multitenancy.
	Explain advantages of Multitenancy and Issues it creates. What could be the unique id of user (should not be emaild).
	Identify the design changes.
	Now make functional breaking changes. Like a user can have multiple accounts. So, should we have something like customerID apart from account number? How would you manage joint accounts?
	How does this imact design. 
	Watch the design most likely it should still be Monolith.
	Teach them Microservices. And explain how the design can scale with microservices.

Usability Slogans
https://nikhilmachcha.wordpress.com/2015/09/24/usability-engineering/
edureka/hexaware/usability_intro.pdf

Why think or learn about Usability

	• Making everyday life easier for people
	• Usability is increasingly becoming a competetive factor (vs.
	functionality)
	• Cost savings
	• Example
		A study showed that 63% of large software projects significantly overran their estimates.
		The four reasons that were rated as having the highest	responsibility were all related to usability engineering:
			
			• frequent requests for changes by users
			• overlooked tasks
			• users’ lack of understanding of their own requirements
			• insufficient user-analyst communication and understanding

	Can you name a software which became successfully simply because it was more usable than it's rivals?
	
		Windows!!

1.1 Cost Savings
	The cost savings from increased usability 
		Many times not directly visible.
		However reduced usability is easily visible.

1.2 Usability Now! 
	Providing better usability is important 
		otherwise it frustrates users
		Especially when they have a comparison.
		
Imagine driving a car without mechanical support. You have to run around turning the wheels. How would you feel.		
		
	A generic design of usability may frustrate a user whose common purpose is simple.
	
1.3 Usability Slogans  
	10 slogans which sound ironical. But makes sense.
	
	1.Your Best Guess is not good enough
		• its impossible to design an optimal interface just by giving it your best try
	
	2.The user is always right
		• The designer must acquire a certain degree of humility and acknowledge the need to modify his design
		• Example:
			A company once tested the usability of a manual, and found that users nearly always made a mistake at a certain point. Their solution was to frame the difficult item in a box and add a note saying “Read these instructions carefully” (Nielsen p.11)
			
	3.The user is not always right
		Unfortunately, user interface designs cannot be derived just by asking users what they like.
		• Users often do not know what they want
		• They might change their minds
		• Users often have diverging opinions
		• Example
		• a study showed that the probability of two persons apply the same name to an object is between 7% and 18%. This means it is not feasible to name commands just by asking some user(s)
		
		
	4.Users are not designers
		• The ideal solution to the usability question might be to leave the design to the individual users by providing extended customisation flexibility
		• novice users do not customize (experienced do)
		• needs good design anyway
		• Example
		• a study compared users abbreviations with systems’ built-in
			found that users made about twice as
		many spelling errors.
	
	5.Designers are not Users
		Designers are not users
		• Systems designers are different from users in several respects
			General computer experience, 
			understanding of the underlying system
		• When you have deep understanding of some system, 
			easy to understand meaning of any feature. 
			This might distort the designers view on system complexity
		• You cannot go back from knowing ‘more’ to knowing ‘less’
	
		My story : Ondu soura rupaya kodi.
	
	6.Vice Presidents are not users
		Vice Presidents may have a strong view. But they also may not represent users.
		Engineers needs to have strong opinion.
			Backed by data
			Confirmed through various sources (customers after giving options).
		
	7.Less is More
		• Every piece of information presented 
			adds to the cognitive load of using the system
		• Example:
		A study of experienced telephone company directory
		assistants showed that finding a target in the top quarter of
		the screen took 5.3 seconds when the screen was half full of
		information and 6.2 when the screen was full.
		- cutting the 0.9 seconds saved the company 40 million $ per
		year


	8.Details Matter
		• Usability often depends on (seemingly) minor details
		• Example
		An indicator in a microwave oven turned gradually from
		white to blue to display the state. Tests showed that the
		phrase “turns blue” was much poorer than “white
		disappears” in the manual, because users became confused
		about “how much blue is blue”
		
	9.Help doesn’t
		• It is not always that users are able to find the help they need in
		e.g. online manuals, or they might misinterpret it
		• Providing a brilliant help system will not change a user-hostile
		interface to a user-friendly one
		• Designers may be tempted to include e.g. online help to cover
		up for a bad design instead of redesigning the interface

	10. Usability Engineering is a process
		More so in Agile world.
		
Usability Test Methods
	• The Different tests during the stages of development
	Exploratory Test
	Heuristic Evaluation
	Assessment Test
	Validation Test
	Comparison Test
Exercise: Heuristic evaluation of Travel Weather GUI
	
Usability Testing
• A process that employs participants who are representative of the target population to evaluate the degree to which a product meets specific criteria
	• Goals
	• to create a history of benchmarks
	• minimizing costs
	• increasing sales
	• competition
	• minimizing risks

Limitations to Usability Tests
	• Testing is always an artificial situation
	• Test results do not prove that a product works
	• Participants are rarely fully representative of the target
	population
	• Testing is not always the best/only technique to use	

Test Methodology for Scientific Experiments
A usability test is formally a controlled scientific experiment. This
signifies that:
	• A specific hypothesis must be formulated.
	• Participants must be randomly chosen
	• The experiment must be tightly controlled (including the role of
	the experimenter)
	• A control group must be employed to validate the results
	• The number of test users must be of sufficient size to ensure
	statistically valid results

	Real-life test situations
	A formal scientific experiment will often be impossible 
	Customers may not sign up
	Due to time pressures, 
	costs, 
	recruitement of test users, etc. 
		
	Research show	
	• To achieve statistically significant results, 10-15 test users per
	condition/variable must be employed
	• The classical scientific theory is aimed at providing proof for a
	hypothesis. In usability engineering our goal might often be a
	more qualitative evaluation
	As an alternative to the classical approach, a series of quick, pointed
	experiments can be employed.

	The cost of such a testing may be significantly more than the benefit.

Adopted Test Methodology
	Instead of the formal scientific approach, the following methodology can be employed:
	• Formulate problem statements or test objectives instead of a
	formal hypothesis
	• Use a representative sample of end users (not necessarily random)
	• Representation of the work environment
	• Observe end users, who either use or review a representation of
	the product. Extensive interviews of the [test] users.
	• Collect quantitative and qualitative measurements
	• Recommendation of improvements

Context of Usability from p 5 of pdf

Exploratory test in usability
	When
		• early in the development cycle
	Objectives
		• to evaluate/explore/investigate the effectsiveness of
	preliminary design concepts
		• gain knowledge of the intended end users (expertise, expectations, goals, etc.)
	Methodology
		• Close interaction between the test users and the experimentor



Exploratory Test Methodology:
	• Use prototype, simulation or mockup of the intended system
		Informal test
		• Paper drawings
		• “shell” GUI
		• Concentrate only on the functionality needed for the
		experiment (e.g. described in a test scenario)
		• “Walk through”
		• Essential uncover the users reactions and thoughts about
		the interaction
		• Focus on why instead of how
		• Often comparative test

Heuristic Evaluation
	When
		• Most often early in the development, i.e. an exploratory test
	Objective
		• Discount Usability Engineering
		• Obtain a list of usability problems (it does note produce a list
	of suggested “bug fixes”
	Methodology
		• non-systematic approach
		• Close interaction with experimentor
		• debriefing/interview test users/evaluators

Assessment Test
	When
	• Either early or midway during the development process, after
	the high-level design has been established
	Objective
	• To continue the process from the explorative test with more
	details of lower-level functions.
	• The assessment test is essentially a test of the implementation
	of the intended design
	Methodology
	• The user actually performs the tasks
	• Less intervention -action from the experimentor
	• Quantitative measures are collected


Validation Test

	When
	• Late in the development
	Objective
	• To validate the usability, against some predefined performance
	criteria or benchmark, competing products, etc.
	• Integrated test
	• Insurance against overlooked flaws/problems
	Methodology
	• Formulate criteria (what and how well)
	• Very little or no interaction with the experimentor
	• Focus on quantitative data
	• Rigorous/tightly controlled test conditions
	
	Comparison Test

	When
	• No specific point in the development cycle
	Objective
	• combined with the other tests. The goal is to compare two or
	more designs
	Methodology
	• Often as a classical scientific test
	• Forces designers (and test users) to contemplate why one
	design is preferred over another

1.4 Discount Usability Engineering
The “discount usability engineering” method is based on the use of the following four techniques:
	• User and task observation
		Simply to observe users, keep quiet, and let the users work as they normally would without interference.

	• Scenarios
	Scenarios are an especially cheap kind of prototype.The entire idea behind prototyping is to cut down on the complexity of implementation by eliminating parts of the full system.Scenarios are the ultimate reduction of both the level of functionality and of the number of features: They can only simulate the
	user interface as long as a test user follows a previously planned path.

	• Simplified thinking aloud
	Basically, it involves having one test user at a time use the system for a given set of tasks while being asked to “think out loud.” By verbalizing their thoughts, users allow an observer to determine not just what they are doing with the interface, but also why they are doing it. This additional insight into a user’s thought process can help pinpoint concrete interface elements that cause misunderstandings,
	so that they can be redesigned.

	• Heuristic evaluation :Usability Heuristics  / Universal Usability Principles (chapter 5)

	• Simple and natural dialogue: Dialogues should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. All information should appear in a natural and logical order.

	• Speak the users’ language: The dialogue should be expressed clearly in words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than in system-oriented terms.

	• Minimize the users’ memory load: The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

	• Consistency: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

	• Feedback: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

	• Clearly marked exits: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.

	• Shortcuts: Accelerators-unseen by the novice user-may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.

	• Good error messages: They should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

	• Prevent errors: Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.

	• Help and documentation: Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, be focused on the user’s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

	• Heuristic Evaluation:
	Heuristic evaluation is done by looking at an interface and trying to come up with an opinion about what is good and bad about the interface. Most people probably perform some kind of heuristic evaluation on the basis of their own intuition and common sense instead.

Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object.

Usability is the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which users achieve specific goals in particular environments; where

Effectiveness is the accuracy and completeness with which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments;

Efficiency is the resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness of goals achieved; and

Satisfaction is the comfort and acceptability of the work system to its users and other people affected by its use.

2.2 Definition of Usability

Usability has multiple components and· is traditionally associated with these five usability attributes:

• Learnability: The system should be easy to learn so that the user can rapidly start getting some work done with the system.

• Efficiency: The system should be efficient to use, so that once the user has learned the system, a high level of productivity is possible.

• Memorability: The system should be easy to remember, so that the casual user is able to return to the system after some period of not having used it, without having to learn everything all over
again.

• Errors: The system should have a low error rate, so that users make few errors during the use of the system, and so that if they do make errors they can easily recover from them. Further, catastrophic
errors must not occur.

• Satisfaction: The system should be pleasant to use,so that users are subjectively satisfied when using it; they like it.

E.g dark whatsapp - but generally people don't like dark website.

Usability engineering is a process
	Design
	Implement
	Evaluate
	
2.4 Usability Trade-Offs
The typical way to achieve this “best-of-both-worlds” effect is to include accelerators in the user interface. Accelerators are user interface elements that allow the user to perform frequent tasks quickly, even though the same tasks can also be performed in a more general, and possibly slower, way.

Typical examples of accelerators include function keys, command name abbreviations, and the use of double-clicking to activate an object.

This means providing better ways to do a set of routine tasks for user maybe ability to customize it,
Ex. Copy & Paste in Wordpad, can be done via Right click of mouse but experts can do with Ctrl +C  & Ctrl + V.
2.5 Categories of Users and Individual User Differences

Three basic categories:
1. Naive
2. Intermediate
3. Expert


The three main dimensions on which users’ experience differs:
1. Knowledge about computers in general,
2. Expertise in using the specific system
3. Understanding of the task domain.
Chapter 3. Generations of User Interfaces 
3.1 Batch Systems
3.2 Line-Oriented Interfaces
3.3 Full-Screen Interfaces
3.4 Graphical User Interfaces
3.5 Next-Generation Interfaces
3.6 Long-Term Trends in Usability

Chapter 4. The Usability Engineering Lifecycle
1. Know the user:
The first step in the usability process is to study the intended users and use of the product.
The concept of “user” should be defined to include everybody whose work is affected by the product in some way, including the users of the system’s end product or output even if they never see a single screen.

a. Individual user characteristics
It is necessary to know the class of people who will be using the system. By knowing the users’ work experience, educational level, age, previous computer experience, and so on, it is possible to anticipate
their learning difficulties to some extent and to better set appropriate limits for the complexity of the user interface.
For example, very young children have no reading ability, so an entirely nontextual interface is required.

b. The user’s current and desired tasks
The users’ overall goals should be studied as well as how they currently approach the task, their information needs, and how they deal with exceptional circumstances or emergencies.
c. Functional analysis
d. The evolution of the user and the job

2. Competitive analysis
It is desirable to analyze existing products heuristically according to established usability guidelines and to perform empirical user tests with these products. A competing product is already fully implemented and can therefore be tested very easily.
Note that a competitive analysis does not imply stealing other people’s copyrighted user interface designs.

3. Setting usability goals
Normally, not all usability aspects can be given equal weight in a given design project, so you will have to make your priorities clear on the basis of your analysis of the users and their tasks.

a. Financial impact analysis
Such an analysis involves estimating the number of users who will be using the system, their loaded salaries or other costs, and the approximate time they will be using the system.
ex. Usability activities that might improve the learnability of the user interface sufficiently to cut down learning-time by one day would be worth $600,000, corresponding to a present value of $500,000

4. Parallel design
The goal of parallel design is to explore different design alternatives before one settles on a single approach that can then be developed in further detail and subjected to more detailed usability activities.
Typically, one can have three or four designers involved in parallel design.In parallel design, it is important to have the designers (or the design teams) work independently, since the goal is to generate as much diversity as possible. Therefore, the designers should not discuss their designs with each other until after they have produced their draft interface designs.

5. Participatory design
Even though the advice to “know the user” may have been followed before the start of the design phase, one still cannot know the user sufficiently well to answer all issues that come up in doing the design.
Instead of guessing, designers should have access to a pool of representative users after the start of the design phase. It is important to have access to the people who will actually be using the system, and not just to their managers or union representatives.

6. Coordinated design of the total interface
Consistency is one of the most important usability characteristics
Consistency is not just measured at a single point in time but should apply over successive releases of a product so that new releases are consistent with their predecessors.
To achieve consistency of the total interface it is necessary to have some centralized authority for each development project to coordinate the various aspects of the interface.

7. Apply guidelines and heuristic analysis
Guidelines list well-known principles for user interface design which should be followed in the development project. In any given project, several different levels of guidelines should be used:
general guidelines applicable to all user interfaces, category-specific guidelines for the kind of system being developed.

8. Prototyping
The entire idea behind prototyping is to cut down on the complexity of implementation by eliminating parts of the full system.Scenarios are the ultimate reduction of both the level of functionality and of the number of features: They can only simulate the user interface as long as a test user follows a previously planned path.

9. Empirical testing (Interface Evaluation)
A classification of evaluation methods on two dimensions:
– whether or not real users are involved and
– whether or not the interface
has actually been implemented.
– Severity Ratings is one of the technique used here.

10. Iterative design
Creating “whole” solution, using Waterfall model is a time consuming task,  there is risk of detecting issue in the end, “Late-risk assessment”. Fixing usability issue at that stage costs more than early stage.
Therefore, Iterative design is preferred.

a. Capture design rationale
The rationale for the various user interface design decisions can be made explicit and recorded for later reference.
Since changes to the interface will often have to be made, it is helpful to know the reasons underlying the original design so that important usability principles are not sacrificed to attain a minor objective.

11. Collect feedback from field use
The main objective of usability work after the release of a product is to gather usability data for the next version and for new, future products.
Basically, the same methods can be used for this kind of field study as for other field studies and task analysis, especially including interviews, questionnaires, and observational studies.
Furthermore, since follow-up studies are addressing the usability of an existing system, logging data from instrumented versions of the software becomes especially valuable for its ability to indicate how the software is being used across a variety of tasks

*********************************************************************
	Think and discuss what is important for user?
	How do you determine what is important for user?
	Should we make some data Bold/ in color or on the top. If yes, how do you determine what data should be presented like that. (How about accessibility of that text).
	On a mobile – we have less real estate and we may present more focused data. You may have 200 columns in the table – how do you determine what to be presented?
	This can be an open debate. Where every one particpates.
	How much of data is required?

api design

https://restfulapi.net/rest-api-design-tutorial-with-example/

Rest API design is a process. Following steps are to be followed.

	- Identify Object Model
		- Identify the objects which will be presented as resources.
		- e.g to list employees - employees would be the object.
		- Lets consider Devices and Configurations as two e.g. 
		- Configurations are sub resource of Devices.
		
	- Create Model URIs
		- Design the basic URI's
		- Endpoints for RESTful services
		- URI: Don't use verbs. Use only nouns
		
		- Since configurations are sub resources for devices. Following could be the design
		/devices #multiple devices
		/devices/{id} #single device
		
		/configurations
		/configurations/{id}
		
		/devices/{id}/configurations
		/devices/{id}/configurations/{id}
		
		
	- Determine Representations
		- Designed generally in xml or json format. YAML?

		
		* Collection of Device Resource
		- Include most used information. Design this intelligently.

    <method href="/devices/12345/synch-config"rel="synch device configuration"/> 
</device>			
		
		* Configuration Resource Collection
			- Similar to device collection.
			- Include most used information intelligently.
			
		* Single Configuration Resource
			- Include complete information
		
		* Important observations
		
		- Resource URIs are all nouns.
		- URIs are usually in two forms – collection of resources and singular resource.
		- Collection may be in two forms primary collection and secondary collection. Secondary collection is sub-collection from a primary collection only.
		- Each resource/collection contain at least one link i.e. to itself.
		- Collections contain only most important information about resources.
		- To get complete information about a resource, you need to access through its specific resource URI only.
		- Representations can have extra links (i.e. methods in single device). Here method represent a POST method. You can have more attributes or form links in altogether new way also.
	
	- Assign HTTP Methods
		- Http Actions are used to map to operations to actions
		HTTP GET /devices
		HTTP GET /configurations
		
		- For large collections always apply pagination
		HTTP GET /devices?startIndex=0&size=20
		HTTP GET /configurations?startIndex=0&size=20
	
		- Create a device and configuration
		HTTP POST /devices
		HTTP POST /configurations
		#generally id is not included in create
		
		Response would be something like

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/xml
Location: http://example.com/network-app/configurations/678678
 
<configuration id="678678">
    <link rel="self" href="/configurations/678678" />
    <content><![CDATA[...]]></content>
    <status>active</status>
    <link  rel="raw configuration content" href="/configurations/678678/raw" /> 
</configuration>
		
		- Update a device or configuration
		HTTP PUT /devices/{id}
		HTTP PUT /configurations/{id}

		Response would be like
		HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/xml
 
<configuration id="678678">
    <link rel="self" href="/configurations/678678" />
    <content><![CDATA[. updated content here .]]></content>
    <status>active</status>
    <link  rel="raw configuration content" href="/configurations/678678/raw" /> 
</configuration>

		- Remove a device or configuration
		HTTP DELETE /devices/{id}
		HTTP DELETE /configurations/{id}

	A successful response SHOULD be 202 (Accepted) if resource has been queues for deletion (async operation), or 200 (OK) / 204 (No Content) if resource has been deleted permanently (sync operation).

		Think whether your delete should be soft or hard delete based on your business use cases.

-	Show some classic examples.
-	How do you test accessibility?


"Accessibility" 
	can be difficult to spell, 
	but it doesn't have to be difficult to accomplish.

What is accessibility?

	When we say a site is accessible, 
	site's content - means - literally for anyone
		its available, 
		its functionality can be operated, 
	
	It's easy to assume that all users 
		can see 
		use a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen, 
		can interact with your page content the same way you do. 
	This can be simple annoyances to show-stoppers for others.
	
	So Accessibility, 
		is experience of users who might be outside the narrow range of the "typical" user
		who might access or interact with things differently than you expect. 
	Specifically, it concerns users who are experiencing some type of impairment or disability — and bear in mind that that experience might be non-physical or temporary.

----------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSHZHQ5los4

Statistics
	- More than 1 billion people globally have some form of disability
	- 15% of worlds population
	- Between 110-190 million people have significant difficulty in functioning.
	- 12.6% of people in US suffers from some kind of disability
	
	Types of disabilities
		- Visual impairment
			- Blindness
			- Partial blindness
			- Low vision
			- Color blindness ect..
		- Lack of motor skills
			- Unable to interact with website.
		- Hearing impairment
			- Full audio loss
			- partial audio loss
			- Low audio 
		- Congnitive disability
			- Mental or behavioural disabilities.
			- Reading difficulties
			- Memory loss
			- Various diseases.


What can really be done?
	understand and implement accessibility guidelines and standards
		- WCAG 2.0 section 508
	Understand accessibility from usage standpoint
		- Usability experts, end-user connect program
	Manual and automated accessibility quality checks
		Right balance, test tools (W3C linkd checker, color contrast analyser tools etc), templates-VPAT
	Third party testing firms which specialize on accessibility.


Mobile Focus
	Functionality
	Mobile Context
	Different devices
	Data entry methods
	Multimodality
	
Different interaction styles
	Mobiles, tabs, laptop, any other devices.
	

Content - Treasure of knowledge
	- Correct size
	- Correct color contrast
	- Minimal flash content
	- Proper alt-text, label
	- Complete coverage
	- Accessiblity through keyboard.
		
	For e.g. a cat with an alt-text=tiger is a bug.
	or a dynamic image which would be loaded based on context.
	
	Guidelines
		Color contrast should be atleast 4.5:1 for foreground:background.
		Large text: 3:1.
		
Key Questions from Usability/Accessibility 
	- Who are your users?
	- What are their tasks
	- env. where they operated
	- type of devices they use?
	- users level of tech-saviness?
	- is lot of reading involved?
	- Govt. regulations.
	
Compliance Stadard - WCAG 2.0 levels of compliance
	Ensures the content is 
	- Perceivable
	- Operable
	- Understandable
	- Robust
	
Levels of Compliance
	- Level A: Min. accessibility requirement
	- Level AA: More involved 
	- Level AAA: Most comprehensive 
	
WCAG offers 12 guidelines each with 3 levels. These guidelines explain how to test and ensure the standards of accessibility.

Quality
	Early testing
	Perform with an iterative approach - automation
	Understand guidelines and use accessibility testing checklist.
	Leverage tools - JAWS, NVDA, Color Contrast Analyzer, VoiceOver/Talkback
	
	Paired Testing
		A expert QA engineer works very closely with a differently abled person.
		From expert experience
		Accessibility test engineer : 40% coverage
		Visually challenged: 70%
		Together : 100%
		
Tools Used
	- Screen Readers (JAWS, NVDA, Talkback, VoiceOver, Window Eyes).
	- Screen Magnifiers - ZoomText
	- Keyboard - Only Testing
	- Color Contrast analyzer
	- Browser Zoom upto 200%
	- High contrast settings
	- Accessibility inspector on iOS.
	- Accessibilitometer
	- Automated Tools (aXe, WAVE)
	
Handy Checklist
	- Meaningful Alt text: Appropriate equivalent alternative text for all images
	- Keyboard Accessible: Page functionality accessible via keyboard
	- Focus Order: Navigation order of links, for elements to be logically correct.
	- Use of Color: Should not be the only mode to communicate
	- Bypass blocks: Direct access to web page's primary content
	- Semantic Markup: Heading, structure, list, blockquote etc.

	accessible. So be careful.
	
	Automated testing
		- best can find < 38% accessibility issues.
		- can find if there is a alt text. But is alt text sensible, can it have a null attribute.
		- Can look at forms, but can't judge whether forms should be there or not.
		- Can't do a good job with colors, scripting, dynamic content ect.
	Human testing
		human judgement
		slower
		tester's skills
		repeating can be a problem
	User Testing
		9 times of 10 and User's finds things that you never thought of.
		Cost of fixing is very high.
		
	Automated testing tools

		Skip to main content options when ever required. TAB for everything may be a bad idea.
		
	Focus visible?
		linux.conf.au - about ect not accessible to users. Focus is not visible.
		
	Keyboard traps?
		Can tab to element and you are blocked. You can neither go past or go back.
		
	Images

		Decorative Vs informative
			Screen reader can ignore decorative and they may lo
	Forms
		Should have labels
			Screen reader uses the labels of Form to understand and announce what is happening with elements
			
		it is associated using the for attribute.
		<label class="hidden" for="fieldId">
		<input id="fieldId" name="fieldId" required="" type="search">
		
		Error messages
			Error messages should be accessible.
			Also about inline error messages. Error messages user gets as we type into a text field. These error messages may not be accessible. If they are accessible also, the users may get to hear that multiple times as they type and so cannot understand what it means.
			Best way to fix it.
			Error messages can be loaded in the begining of the form. As the user makes a mistake make it visible and focus on that. So user would get to see/hear that.
			
		Inline validation
		Focus managment
		aria-describedby
		
		Timeout: Need to be accessible.
		Notify users session about to expire: Need to be accessible.
		
	Document Structure
		Heading Hierarchy
		Skipped headings
		Missing headings
		Empty headings 
		
	Language
		Document language declared?
			Declare in the html header: what is the language.  Changes in language defined?
		
		Changes in language.
			Change in language in any section should be clearly visible/announced to the user
			
	Text Resize
		Text Resize to 200%. Accessibility impact.
		
	Windows high contrast
		How does it look?
		Can you see all elements.
		
		Disable people work with high contrast.
		Windows - Settings - Search "High contrast" settings.
			Suddenly https://linux.conf.au becomes accessible.
		But if we use svg icons or background images they would not be present in high contrast.
		
		Color Contrast
			Refer other notes
			4.5:1 and 3:1
			
		Tables
			Don't use it for layout.
			Use it only for tabular data.
			
			Ensure tables are easily passible by Screen Readers.
			
			Ensure Tables have TH and TH are associated with Table rows using scope attribute.
			<th scope col>
			Associate table cells with headers. So when it reads the cell data, it will also say for what it is.
			
		Tables - layout
			Don't use tables for layout. If it is required (e.g. tables in email), use role="presentation". It will skip reading, there is a table with x column and y rows ect.
			
		Audio & Video
			Should have captions and transcripts.
			Don't rely on automated captions in youtube.
			Controls should be accessible through keyboard.
			Volume up/down. Space for pause and play should all work.

----------------------------------------------------------------
	Following discussion is centered around Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 - The details can be found below 
	https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/
	
	WCAG is organized around four principles often called by the acronym POUR:

		Perceivable: Can users perceive the content? This helps us keep in mind that just because something is perceivable with one sense, such as sight, that doesn't mean that all users can perceive it.
		Like pass in green is not perceivable to a color blind.
		
		Operable: Can users use UI components and navigate the content? For example, something that requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can't use a mouse or touch screen.

		Understandable: Can users understand the content? Can users understand the interface and is it consistent enough to avoid confusion?

		Robust: Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of user agents (browsers)? Does it work with assistive technology?

	While WCAG provides a comprehensive overview 
	It can be overwhelming for most.
	So WebAIM (Web Accessibility in Mind) group has distilled the WCAG guidelines into an easy-to-follow checklist...

•	Product Architecture – self-contained, State – SOLID principles etc. Microservices, API
o	Introduction to software product architecture.
	- Product architecture is the scheme by which the functional elements of the products are arranged into physical chunks and by which the chunks interact.
	- These chunk become the building blocks of the product.
	- The definition links architecture to system-level design and the principles of system engineering.
	- Architecture also has profound implications for how the product is designed, made, sold, used, repaired etc..
	- Architecture makes its influence felt during assembly.

o	What is product architecture
	Arechitecture's influences
	- During product development
		- How families and platforms are structured
		- How functions are realized
		- How reuse and standadization are accomplished
		- How development work is divided up
		- Where subassembly and module boundaries are
		- Where DFC's (Distributed feature composition) go?
			- In the product
			- In the organization
			- Along the supply chain
	During proudction system design
		- Assembly sequences
		- Reuse of facilities and knowledge
		- Planning for flexibility
		- Sharing of facilities to match capacity to demand
	During manufacturing and assembly
		- Where production happens
		- How customer orders are fulfilled
		- How unpredictable demand ptterns are method
	During use
		- How services are delivered
		- How the product is updated
		- How the product is recycled
	
	Architecture should 
	- At planning: Decide platform.
	- Concept development: Decide concept
	- System level design: Decide decomposition. Make architectural decision (e.g. should we support diognosability. If yes, how can be differed to detail design)
	- Detail design: clear understanding of decomposition and how they interact. How it will be tested. How it will be delivered? How it can be orchestrated (how api's interact and how it can scale)? How it can be updated? Processes to be followed? 
	
	Product architecture is determined early in the development process. Latter you follow the architecture. Compare this with a building architecture.
	
	Development: Implementation of architectural decisions.
	- Testing and Refinement: Implementation of test strategy. 
	- Production Ramp-up: Implementation of the deployment and rollout strategy.
o	Why do we need architecture?
	Without an architecture we are clueless on what to build? Imagine building a house without an architecture.
o	Principles of Product architecture
o	Self contained architecture


	Importance of Product Architecture
		- Decided early and drives design
		- Impacts manufacturing cost
		- Impacts product evolution
	
	Impact of Architecture
		1. Product changes
			- Upgrade 
			- add-ons
			- Adaptation
			- Consumption
			- Flexibility in use
			- Reuse
		2. Product Variety
		3. Component Standardization
		4. Product Performance
		5. Manufacturability
		6. Product development management
		
	Architecture are of two types
	- Modular Architecture
	- Integral Architecture

	Modular Product Architecture
		- Each physical chunk implements one or a few functional elements in their entirety
		- The interactions between chunks are well defined.
	Integral Product Architecture
		- Functional elements are implemented by multiple chunks 
			or
		- A chunk may implement many functions
		- Interactions between chunks may be poorly defined.
		- Integral architecture generally increases performance and reduces costs for any specific model.
		
	e.g. integral model
		mouse embedded inside a laptop.

 S: Single responsibility principle
 ----------------------------------
 
 What is the responsibility of this class?
 What if we had multiple responsibility?
 
 Class should have only one and only responsibility.
 There should be only one reason due to which a class has to be change

 The principle can be well understood with an example. Imagine there is a class which performs following operations.

	Review MVC to understand SRP
	

	Connected to a database
	Read some data from database tables
	Finally, write it to a file.

	What are the classes you would design?
		Need one DAO, FileManagement, Entity and Management classes.
	What are the methods you would define?
	What are the unit test cases and integration test cases you would define?

	Make a change
	Change the db. What is the impact to functionalities? What are the impacts on test cases?
	What if we need to read from more than one db?
Any additional testing required?

Have you imagined the scenario? Here the class has multiple reasons to change, and few of them are the modification of file output, new data base adoption. When we are talking about single principle responsibility, we would say, there are too many reasons for the class to change; hence, it doesn’t fit properly in the single responsibility principle.


Why SRP
 testing is easier	
 the class will have fewer test cases.
 better code organization
 easy to maintain
 less cost
 easy to understand
 
public class UserSettingService
{
	public void changeEmail(User user)
	{
	if(checkAccess(user))
	{
	//Grant option to change
	}
	}
	public boolean checkAccess(User user)
	{
	//Verify if the user is valid.
	}
}

#when the logic of checkAccess changes, we may have to modify the same class.

******************************************
Single Responsibility Principle
	- A class should have only single responsibility. A single reason to change.
	e.g. ScoreRecorder
	
	- Based on separation of concerns.
	
	- Vary each concern independently of other concern.

	- Each class should be designed to do one thing and it should do it well.

	- The size of the classes become shorter. This makes code easily understandable

********************************************************


 O: Open-closed principle
 ----------------------------------
Bertrand Mayer, in his 1988 book, Object-Oriented Software Construction: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  open for extension, but closed for modification
  Extension can be through composition or inheritance.
  Jenkins plugin, Browser plugin ect.
  why OCP?
  classes may come to us through third-party libraries.
  Lets say we need to calculate areas of various shapes. We start with creating a class for our first shape Rectangle which has 2 attributes length & width.
  
  Open for extension – This means that the behavior of the module can be extended. As the requirements of the application change, we are able to extend the module with new behaviors that satisfy those changes. In other words, we are able to change what the module does.

  Closed for modification – Extending the behavior of a module does not result in changes to the source or binary code of the module. The binary executable version of the module, whether in a linkable library, a DLL, or a Java .jar, remains untouched.
  
  public class Rectangle
{
public double length;
public double width;
}
***********************************

Refer Shape.css and ShapeFixed.css

Open Closed Principle

	- Writing something very specific to solve some specific problem can lead to writing same code multiple time which in turn results in code duplication

	- Code duplication leads to maintainability problem.

	- Reused abstraction principle – if we have multiple abstractions which are not being used by the concrete class then it is a sign of poor designing and abstractions.

	- Interfaces are not designed but they are discovered. You don't need design for interfaces instead you just need to discover it.

	- Start with the concrete behaviour and discover the abstraction as commonality emerges.

	- Rule of three – Unless and until we have three places where we think that the code is same, it is generally not advised to abstract out the functionality.
Open for extensibility but closed for modification. If we have a class which is being used by other clients, that class should be open for extensibility. The only reason to change the class should be to fix a bug in the class.
We should favor Composition over inheritance which I will discuss in next principles.
We can make a class open for extensible is by adding virtual keyword to the methods of the class.

***********************************  
 L: Liskov substitution principle
 ----------------------------------
 The only thing is that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their parent or base class.
 avoids misusing inheritance.
 “is-a” relationship.
 
Liskov Substitution Principle
-----------------------------
	Applicable only for about polymorphism (inheritance). 
	Named after barbara liskov, in 70’s
	Derived types must be substituted for base types.
	Client can consume any implementation without changing the correctness of the system
	We can change the behaviour of the system because polymorphism is all about changing the behaviour.
	Correctness of the system can be said as the implementation of the interface A should not crash the application. Similarly implementation of the interface B should also not crash the application (compile time error or a new call itself fails). 

Breaking the LSP:

	When we get the NotSupportedException.
	One interesting implementation which violates LSP in C# is ReadOnlyCollection. Once the collection is created it cannot be changed. We cannot add or remove the items from the collection.
	So Add , clear and Remove methods in ReadOnlyCollection throw the NotSupportedExceptions. It can break the correctness of the system because suppose if one part of the client is accepting only the ICollection and it was working fine with List implementation . But if we substitute it with ReadOnlyCollection, it will break for Add, Clear and Remove methods and thus putting the correctness of the system in jeopardy.
	
 
public class Rectangle

	private int length;

	public int getLength()

 I: Interface segregation principle
 ----------------------------------
 Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use.
 Why is that this principle is required?

ISP

	- ISP is  SOLID design principle which is used to help us achieve the LSP by having more granularity.
	- Clients should not depend on methods they do not use. As we have see in the previous code example. VolumeCalculator should not depend on the GetVolume methods of the classes.
	- Interface are introduced to achieve loose coupling and its not the classes that use the interfaces but clients are the one who use interfaces.
	- Clients define the interface and there is no need for a client to define a method in the interface if the client doesn’t need the method in the interface.
	- Prefer role based interfaces over header interfaces. Header interfaces are created by abstracting out of the existing classes as we have done in designing previous system.
	- If client need to define the interface it only need to define a very few methods in the interface. These are role interface.
	There are many ways by which we can extend the functionality of the class e.g. by inheritance, by using generics or by using extension methods.
	But there are very less way by which we can reduce the methods in the class. Indeed there is only one way and that is ISP.

How SOLID principles Solves read world Application Problems
Some of the design smell I which I want to discuss here are.

	Rigidity – The design is difficult to change. Without proper use of abstraction and interface the design becomes very rigid. For each and every small change in the functionality we have to test whole logic from start.
	
	Fragility – Design is easy to break. As discussed with a small change there are very high 	chances of the whole design going for a toss.

	Immobility – The design is difficult to reuse. Or rather we cannot easily extend the current design.
	
	Viscosity – It is difficult to do the right thing.

	Needless Complexity – Over design.

You have a bakery. You need to prepare a cake. How would you do that?

Class orderCake(){
	Cake cake = new Cake();
	
	cake.prepare();//mix, spread, put ingrediants ect..
	cake.bake();//put into own/otg
	cake.cut();
	cake.box();
	return cake;
}

https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/tree/master/factory-method

But you need to prepare different types of cake.. ButterScotch, Vanilla ect..

Class Bakery{
	public Cake orderCake(String type){
		Cake cake;
			
		if ("ButterScotch".equals(type)){
			cake = new ButterScotchCake();
		}else if ("Vanilla".equals(type)){
			cake = new VanillaCake();		
		}else if ("Pineapple".equals(type)){
			cake = new PineappleCake();		
		}//Each Cake has to implement the cake interface
		
		cake.prepare();//mix, spread, put ingrediants ect..
		cake.bake();//put into own/otg
		cake.cut();
		cake.box();
		return cake;
	}
}

#####################################

Your competitors decide to add couple of new cake types. You see that Butterscotch is not selling. You want to take it out.
How will code look like?

This violates the closed for modification principle.

Let's encapsulate what changes

public class CakeFactory{
	public Cake createCake(String type){
		if ("Vanilla".equals(type)){
			cake = new VanillaCake();		
		}else if ("Pineapple".equals(type)){
			cake = new PineappleCake();		
		}
	}
}

Let's rewrite our Bakery class

Class Bakery{

	CakeFactory factory;
	public Bakery(CakeFactory factory){
		this.factory = factory;
	}
	
	public Cake orderCake(String type){
		Cake cake;
		cake = factory.createCake(type);//Here new is replaced. No more concrete instantiation here.
		
		cake.prepare();//mix, spread, put ingrediants ect..
		cake.bake();//put into own/otg
		cake.cut();
		cake.box();
		return cake;
	}
}

This is not factory pattern
Class diagram for what we did can be found in Page9	


Now many people like our cake. So we want to open lot of franchises across the city.
Say 
	one in Chennai, 
	one in Ahmedabad //like everything sweet.
	one in Culcutta //like everything with more Ghee
	one in Mumbai //likes a different souce flavour in everything
	one in Delhi //likes less sweet.
	
But the taste of the people in these areas differ..

Let's get the createCake back into Bakery.

Class Bakery{
	public Cake orderCake(String type){
		Cake cake;
		cake = this.createCake(type);//createCake is a local method.		
		cake.prepare();//mix, spread, put ingrediants ect..
/*
How to prepare Cake?
	Beat egg and add sugar.
	Add Vanilla esence and veg oil
	Add pineapple or strawberry purie
	Add Maida and Baking powder
	Depending on the flavour can be pine apple cake or orange.
*/		
		cake.bake();//put into own/otg
		cake.cut();
		cake.box();
		return cake;
	}
	
	public abstract Cake createCake(String type);
}

public class AhmedabadCake{
	public Cake createCake(String type){
		Cake cake = new Cake();	
		if(type.equals("Pineapple"){
			cake = new AhmedabadStylePineappleCake();
		}else if(type.equals("ButterScotch"){
			cake = new AhmedabadStyleButterScothCake();
		}...
	}
}

New type of Cake comes, where are the changes restricted to?

Similarly do it for Culcutta


There is still lot happening in your Bakery. It doesn't need to bother which cake it is, the baking, cutting, boxing ect are independent of that.

abstract Product factoryMethod(String type)

abstract: A factory method is abstract so the subclasses can handle the object creation.

Product: factory method returns a product that is typically used within methods defined in the superclass

factoryMethod: factory method isolates the client from what kind of concrete class is getting created. (e.g. for them it would be a Cake type).

String type: factory methods may be parameterized to select among several variation of a product.

Now if Ram and Rahim are ordering a Cake. If Ram wants Chennai Cake and Rahim wants Culcutta cake.
Ram
	Bakery bakery = ChennaiBakery();
	bakery.orderCake("Pineapple");
	

Rahim
	Bakery bakery = CulcuttaBakery();
	bakery.orderCake("Pineapple");
	
	
Code the cakes...	
p-130
Excercise - do it for Songs from different part of country.

Factory: defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclass decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.


Refer class diagram in p 134

Advantage of Factory Pattern
	Factory Pattern is useful when you need to create only a single product. 
	If you need to create multiple products or a group of products - Factory cannot help.

Is SimpleBakery (move encapsulation of first create to a different class. Although it looks similar SimpleBakery doesn't extend a class creating 

Are factory method and creatory always abstract	
	No, you can define a default factory method to produce some cocnrete product
	
CulcuttaBakery creates 2 or more deferent type of Cakes. Do they always needs to create n number of Cakes?
	We implemented a parameterized factory. You can do a default factory too (with no parameter) and decide to create just one type of product.
	
Our factory is not type safe. It takes a String as type and that can take any value.
	Good observation. There are various ways to solve this. One being enumerator.
	
I'm still a bit confused between factory and SimpleBakery. They look very similar.
	You are right - the subclasses looks a lot like SimpleBakery. In Factory however we are creating a framework where the subclass decide what to be created. 
	
	imagine if we need to create this without factory in the old method.
	
************************************************************
Design pattern 2: Abstract Factory
************************************************************
Abstract Factory is a group of Factories.

Provides an interface for creating a families of dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Refer notebook

************************************************************



There had been report of some quality compromise in some bakeries which you don't like.
Clearly we need to manage createCake from a centralized place.
But the definition of quality in each place is different. So how do we do this?

public interface CakeIngrediantFactory{
	/*
How to prepare Cake?
	Beat egg and add sugar.
	Add Vanilla esence and veg oil
	Add pineapple or strawberry purie
	Add Maida and Baking powder
	Depending on the flavour can be pine apple cake or orange.
*/		
//All these should be like create methods because we are making these in our factories.
	public Sugar createSugar();
	public Egg createEgg();
	public Vanilla creteVanilla();
	public VegOil createVegOil();
	public Maida createMaida();
	public BakingPowder createBakingPowder();
}

Here is what we will now do.
1. Create a Factory for each region.
	Create a sub class of CakeIngrediantFactory that implements each create method.
2. Implement a set of ingrediant classes to be used.
3. Hook up by working wih our new ingrediant factories.

public class HyderbadIngrediantFactory implements CakeIngrediantFactory{
	public Sugar createSugar(){
		return new SweetLessSugar();
	}
	public Egg createEgg(){
		return new LargeEgg();
	}
	public Vanilla creteVanilla(){
		return new FlavouredVanilla();
	}
	public VegOil createVegOil(){
		return new nonVegOil();
	}
	public Maida createMaida(){
		return new HardMaida();
	}
	public BakingPowder createBakingPowder(){
		return new ExtraBakingPowder();
	}
}

Strategy Design pattern
	Using composition than inheritance
	
	Defines a family of algorithms and encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeble
	
	Lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
	
	i.e. make algorith plug and play. Sometimes use algorith A and sometimes algorith B.
	
	Consider that you are creating a voting website.
	Based on the country you may have different algorith to allow a person to vote. If Indian, you may check Aadhar or voting card and allow to vote. If a different country it may just if your name is present in the list and if your face match.
	
	or 
	If you have a collection which has a sorting functionality, at runtime you can decide the sorting should be based on which algorithm.

Story of a movie
Heroine walk in wearing a colorful dress with background
Boys are all interested.
They keeps checking with her every min. and she shouts back.
Then they start subscribing.                   


Newspaper - subscription
          
Weather station. Measure the weather data.

	A client wants to know when ever the wheather data changes.
	This client is a subscriber.
	
	Push Vs Pull
	Move from Pull to Push
	
	Keeps checking every min.
	
	Pulling is a very inefficient bad idea.
	
	For pushing the subject (here wheather measurement system) should know all the subscribers.
	Observable: Subject is called Observable.
	And clients are called Observers.
	Observers observe the observable.
	
Observer Pattern
----------------
	defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notidied and updated automatically. 
	
	
Chatroom is a good usecase where you can use Observer pattern


###########################################

Explain what is a Proxy and Reverse Proxy.

----------------------------------------------------
Definition
----------
Provides a place holder for another object in order to control access to it.


You call a object which intern calls the object which you need to call.

A -> B -> C

3 styles of Proxy pattern
	Remote proxy
		In a different machine/cluster ect.
		This proxy is responsible to interact with the remote system.
		For the client proxy is the remote object.
	Virtual proxy
		Controls access to a resource that is expensive to create (like caching or pooling?).
		
	Protection proxy
		Access management.
		Controls access to a resource using access rights.
		
	
e.g. of Virtual Proxy
	String book = "<Entire book>";
	BookParser bp = new BookParser();//heavy instantiation which does lot of computation.
	bp.getWordCount();//simple getter
	bp.getSentenceCount();
	
	But what if bp.getXX method may not be accessible always. So instead of creating it always, I would like to differ it to the first method call.
	
	Client -> Proxy -> instantiate BookParser on the first method call.
	
	Refer note Book for class dia.
	Proxy always extends the same interface as the subject.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29117570/orchestrating-microservices

https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/microservices-when-to-react-vs-orchestrate-c6b18308a14c

Saga pattern, 
routing slips, 
stateful workflows
Circuit breaker pattern
Side-car pattern

****************************************

Orchestration: 
	Getting a bunch of services to work nicely together in order to get some real work done. 
	
	Most cases try to reduce the coupling using RESTful api design.
	
Following are some tips of Orchestration
	1. Be Clear As Crystal
		Services should include information like diagnosability, logging, ect.
		Many times our service may be just a service in the middle, yet may get blamed for failures. 
		When there is a failure we should be able diagnose the root cause of failure easily. For e.g. include information like the api which failed. provide a link to the api and how we can contact them.
		Provide support when customer needs it.
	
	2. Don't be a transformer
		Orchestrator should not try to transform. Orchestrator is not a transformer.
		If you own the underlying services, avoid tight coupling with the services.
	
		Define the standards (for e.g. diagnosability support) required for you to orchestrate them.
		If you have to transform, then follow a standard pattern like Facade, Adapter, Decorater ect with proper diagnosability.
	
	3. Keep it small
		a. Ensure the surface area of coupling between you and the services you orchestrate is small. Keep it to a few fields. 
		Ensure the rules to each schema are relatively simple. If possible, keep the interfaces consistent across all services, both in the requests and in the responses. The more you are coupled to the surfaces of these services, the more painful and frequent the changes will be to your code.

		b. Ensure you keep chattiness to a minimum between services. That means a small, infrequent surface area of network calls. The more network calls that go back and forth between two services or between you and a service, the more pain you'll have to deal with. You also will have highly latent communication. This is usually a sign that the team or teams have badly designed the services.

	4. Be Fault tolerant
		As the fallacies of distributed computing point out, working with distributed systems is unreliable at best. You have to be prepared for their failure and respond accordingly. This often means retrying intermittent failures and circuit breaking permanent ones. You can cache slowly changing data and skip bad services if coordinating a chain of them. If you think not only about the happy paths in your orchestration, but also about the paths of failure you will have a system that costs much less to maintain.

	5. Use known patterns
		There are so many patterns which have been used widely. Use them to solve 
		
		List of patterns 
			Saga pattern
			Routing slips
			Stateful workflow
			
			Side-car
			Adapter
			Facade
			Client-side Discovery and Server-side Discovery
			Messaging and Remote Procedure Invocation patterns
	


	6. Make your orchestration observable
		Already discussed in Observer pattern.
		
	7. Find places where you need to orchestrate.
		Utilize various design patterns discussed to keep your surface low. 
*************************************
From https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491950358/

There are two styles. 
	1. The orchestration style corresponds more to the SOA idea of orchestration/task services, 
	2. Choreography style corresponds to the dumb pipes and smart endpoints 		

https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/microservices-when-to-react-vs-orchestrate-c6b18308a14c

Orchestration is the traditional way of handling interactions between different services in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). With orchestration, there is typically one controller that acts as the “orchestrator” of the overall service interactions. This typically follows a request/response type pattern.

Look at the image in the above link.

Benefits
Provides a good way for controlling the flow of the application when there is synchronous processing. For example, if Service A needs to complete successfully before Service B is invoked.
Tradeoffs
Couples the services together creating dependencies. If service A is down, service B and C will never be called.
If there is a central shared instance of the orchestrator for all requests, then the orchestrator is a single point of failure. If it goes down, all processing stops.
Leverages synchronous processing that blocks requests. In this example, the total end-to-end processing time is the sum of time it takes for Service A + Service B + Service C to be called.

Reactive 
--------
	Event driven.
	
Hybrid
------
	Combination of both.
	
	To know more about the above. When to use Hybrid Vs Reactive Vs Orchestration ect. read the above medium.com link.

Discuss Facade design pattern - Explain how Facade helps in orchestration

Facade 
	Also called
	Principle of least knowledge
	Law of [Demeter]

Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
Defines higher level interface that makes subsystem easier to use.

Refer note book.

Many times because of SRP, you will end up having lot of classes. You may have to create so many classes

Referring to the note book drawing

Client -> Facade -> A, M, X

some classes may be with dependency injection. Say if A is created with B's depency injected.

A a = new A (new B(new C, new N)))))

	why do we need to consider orchestration during design?

------------------------------------------------------------
Let's look at a couple of micro services
	- Shopping cart management
	- Order placed
	
	Should above 2 be different service or sing service
	
	Now I want the report of how many orders got confirmed after people started adding items to cart. 
	Is it a single db query?
	
	How do we solve this?
	So do you see a need to design microservices properly.
	
------------------------------------------------------------
		
	https://specify.io/concepts/microservices
	
	Microservice architecture : good for building scalable applications. 
	i.e.
		Microservices design can scale horizontally.
		It should
			technically scale with load
			functionally scale as requirement changes
				it is easy to introduce new functions and qualities at any stage of the product. 
	We have to carefully design it that way.
	
	purposes and risks of microservice architectures. 

	Purpose 1: Minimize Costs of Change
	Purpose
	Microservices are intended to scale according to new requirements.
	Minimizing the costs for new or changed requirements is the major purpose of the microservice architecture style. This benefit comes directly from the “single responsibility principle”. 
	
To prevent that code is added where it doesn’t belong to and to ensure changeability, the microservice pattern recommends that:

	
	- different responsibilities are placed in different services
	- each service has its own code repository
	- each instance of a microservice is executed as a dedicated process
	- inter service communication is only allowed through a network connection. 
		- Services must use its official API to talk to each other: 
		- A service doesn't access the db of another servie directly.
	- the protocol used for communication must be technology agnostic 
		- i.e. a service should NOT assume another service is written in a technology in anyway.
	- choreography should be preferred over orchestration
		In Orchestration, there is a centralized orchestrator which controls.
		In Choreography, every microservice performs their actions independently. It does not require any instructions.
		
Each microservice architecture is a service oriented architecture, but not the other way around. There are some discussions whether microservices are SOA done right.

Difference between service oriented architecture and microservice architecture 
	smaller services size and lightweight protocols. 
	The smaller service size is a result of applying the first principle from the list above: place different responsibilities into different services.

Enforced cohesion because of hard system boundaries
---------------------------------------------------
	Cohesion in software architecture is a measure how related the responsibilities of a module are. When a module has responsibilities that are strongly related to each other, this module has a high cohesion.

	Attention: Don’t fall into the trap and put related responsibilities into different services!

	Because different responsibilities are placed in different code repositories, it is much harder to place new code into modules to which they don’t belong to by design. This is a common problem in traditional applications:

	Developers will eventually ignore or oversee boundaries of subsystems due to time pressure or insufficient understanding of the larger code base. As a consequence of that, related logic is distributed across system boundaries and it is much harder to maintain and extend the software. Subsequently the test suite gets also more complex and this is another reason why it's harder to ensure that everything is still working after a code change.

Lower coupling because of high cohesion
---------------------------------------
	"Low coupling often correlates with high cohesion, and vice versa" [SADCW]. In a good designed microservice architecture the dependencies between services are minimized. 
	One reason for that is the same as for the enforced cohesion:

	It is hard for developers to introduce new communication paths without to talk to the developers of the other services. Even if there is only one developer involved, he will be more thoughtful in introducing new dependencies between two services then between modules within the same code base.

Lower coupling because of choreography
--------------------------------------
	Another driver for lower coupling is that in a microservice architecture choreography is preferred over orchestration. 
	Refer to the image in https://specify.io/concepts/microservices#cohesion-system-boundaries
	kubernetes may be considered under choreography and not orchestration.
	When a service oriented architecture uses an orchestration pattern for communication, there are point-to-point connection between the services. Point-to-point means that one service calls the API of another service which results in a web of communication paths between all services. Integrating, changing or removing services from this web is hard since you have to be aware of each connection between the services.

	Comparison between the orchestration pattern and the choreography pattern
	Orchestration vs. Choreography, Source: www.thoughtworks.com
	Applying a choreography pattern means that one service doesn’t talk to another service in order to instruct an action. Instead each service is observing its environment and acts on events autonomous.

	Orchestration
	-------------
	(Refer image) Services are connected to a message bus and subscribe channels they are interested in. Once an event series occurs that matters of the service, the service performs the appropriate action. Now it is easy to add new services to the architecture; You simply have to connect them to the message bus. In the worst case you must ensure that the other services emit the events that 
	
	the new service requires. But adding addional events or extending the payload of existing events won’t break existing logic.

A more concreate example of orchestration vs choreography.
microservices orchestration vs choreography examples
Orchestration vs. Choreography Examples, Original examples published in:
Building Microservices by Sam Newman, O'Reilly
Note: When it comes to create/read/update/delete entities the REST protocol should still be a consideration. The service that handles the REST call could then trigger an event that a new entity was created/updated/deleted.

Applying another rule from the list above will result in an even lower coupling: When technology agnostic protocols are used, different services can be developed in different technologies. So it is possible to pick the best suited technologies for each service/team.

In the end a lower coupling allows to replace, remove or add new services when requirements change without having the fear that some communication paths have been oversee. So, a lower coupling allows to make changes to the architecture at a later state with less effort.

Smaller and cleaner code bases because of separated services
Each service has a small code base and so it is easier for developers to extend or modify a service. Even when a developer hasn’t worked on a service for a while or when a developer is new in the project, the smaller code bases makes it possible to be productive right from the beginning.

More source code causes much more errors
Source: twitter.com/mmrichards/..
In addition, removing dead code to clean up the code base is much simpler in smaller code bases. In traditional applications developers are worried about removing unused code because they fear site effects. Furthermore, because of the simplicity the likelihood to introduce errors is also reduced.

The final point of smaller code bases is that the IDE loads faster :)

Smaller teams because of smaller code bases
The people which develop and maintain a service can be organized in a small team where each team maintains and/or operates one service (or a small set of services). Smaller teams minimize management overhead within the teams and will increase productivity dramatically.

Interim conclusion
Because a microservice architecture is made for adding requirements at any time this architecture style is very good fit for agile development processes. It is possible to implement a minimum viable product, deliver it to the user and than extend the system over time.

"Applying a microservice architecture is not about building the perfect system instead it is about to build a framework in which a good system can emerge over time as the understanding grows." [bms, S. 15]

However, a still existing problem is that responsibilities are assigned to the wrong service by design. When it comes to design a microservice architecture many people don’t know how to divide a monolithic problem into multiple (micro)services. And in fact, when the services are too big or to small, the advantages are gone and problems arise. This then bothers developers and also the managers who decided to invest into this architecture style.

Hint: Making services too small is common pitfall. This antipattern is called “nanoservices”.

So, lets have a look at the most asked question in discussions about microservices: How small a service should be? The following section " encourage Generalization, Replaceability and Reuse " should give you an idea on how to approach this problem.

Purpose 2: Encourage Generalization, Replaceability and Reuse
Purpose
In microservices the lesson learned from SOA are applied to fulfil the promise of reuse.
Reusing services is an old idea and in service oriented architecture (SOA) this is a fundamental goal. The microservice architecture style promotes the following principle to reach the best reusability for a single service:

Build smaller services doing one thing well. This is similar to the rule from the section above: Different responsibilities should be placed in different services.
A typical show stopper in discussion about reusing an existing service is its complexity and that the existing solution does much more then actual required. Often you hear statements like “this is a simple problem we better build our own solution instead of learning how to use an existing one”. To make things worse a complex software goes along with a complex documentation. How often did you hear a colleague complaining about a documentation?

There are some rules of thumb out there how small a microservice should be:

" The service can be rewritten and redeployed in 2 weeks. " , Jon Eaves
" It must be possible to feed a team that maintains a service with two pizzas. " , Werner Vogels
These are good rules of thumb and one could argue that these are extreme examples. Two weeks two rewrite a service is a desirable time range but according to the pizza example I must always work in a one-man team.

To get a well designed microservice architecture we should not ask how big a service should be, instead we should ask: which responsibilities should go into the same service?

My opinionated answer to this is that responsibilities should be grouped in a way so that the amount and size of domain specific services is minimized. Domain specific services, in this context, are services that are specific to the problem domain and that it's unlikely to find a scenario for reusing them in other projects.

Conversely this means: The amount of reused or reusable services should be maximized.

In order master that challenge, I like to think of two dimensions of decomposition.

Decomposition Dimension 1: Actions on entities
Actions that requires access to the same database records should go into the API of same service. For example, creating, reading, updating and deleting an entity (e.g. a user) should be provided by the API of the same service.

Recap: It’s a no-go that more then one service accesses the same database since it breaks up cohesion (see section ‘Purpose 1: Minimize Costs of Change’). When a services A requires information of service B, service A must use the API of service B.

Furthermore, entities that have a strong relation to each other are good candidates to be managed by the same services. From the perspective of reusing a service: When you can’t think of a scenario where you use an entity without the other, it’s an indication that those entities should be better managed by the same service.

Decomposition Dimension 2: Aspects of an action
Just because an action is provided by the API of one service it doesn’t mean that every aspect of that action must be executed by that service. It is often possible to decompose a domain specific action into one or more generic actions. In such cases we should think to leave those aspects of an action to other services.

A simple example: When a new user signs up at an online shop, an email to this user should be send. It is a good idea to use an email service to send out those emails. Why? In case the layout of all emails should be changed each service that sends emails must be changed. Sending emails is such a generic problem that there are tons of services out there that can be reused.

A more complex example: When a customer of an online shops views a product the shop system should remember this in order to generate user specific advertisements. In this example, we have a service that manages products. Putting the logic to generate user specific advertisements would blow up the complexity of the product service. Instead we should make a research which off-the shelf software can perform such user specific advertisements and use this system along with the product service. Whenever product information gets requested by an user the product service will notify the advertisement system. FYI: When an user opens a page on amazon about 200 services are called to perform this action (see [WV]).

Another example: Imagine a fitness tracker wristband that records and analyzes your vitality. Because of the limited disk space and computation power, it sends your vitality data (and maybe your current position) to a microservice architecture. One service acts as an endpoint and is responsible for receiving the data records from the wristbands. To keep the first service simple, this service is just responsible to receive and dispatch the data records. To store and analyze the heart rate we need something like a “heart rate service” that is able to calculate the average heart rate of a given time period in the past (because we want to display this information to the user). Making a generalization step before implementing a heart rate service can save us a lot of work. The heart rate service is actually a time series database that can be used off the shelf.

Purpose 3: Increase Operations Efficiency
Purpose
Only scale the bottlenecks.
In sum the footprint of an microservice architecture is usually bigger then the footprint of a monolithic application. This is because in a microservice architecture each service must run as a separated process. This means each instance of a service requires its own runtime (e.g. JVM, Ruby interpreter, etc.).

Hint: The serverless architecture pattern mitigates this costs by using the same runtime for different services.

But there is a break-even point when it comes to horizontal scaling. When scaling a monolithic application horizontally you must install the whole monolith multiple times. This is a kind of waste because often only a small part of the application becomes the bottleneck. With a microservice architecture you can only scale those part that actually have performance issues. For systems under constant high load the hardware resources are cheaper when a microservice architecture is in place.

Risk 1: Increase Operations Complexity
Risk
One disadvantage of the microservice architecture is obvious: It is necessary to operate much more applications than just one or two. Mature organizations use container (e.g. Docker), PaaS (e.g. Cloud Foundry) technologies and continuous delivery methodologies to mitigate this drawback.

Risk 2: Distributed Monolith
In case your architecture has a bad cohesion you will multiply all problems by distributing your application across different microservices (see [JS]).

###########################################################
	The process of storing data in a cache.
	a temporary storage area
	Deliver data quickly.
	
	Caching works on locality of reference principle: recently requested data is likely to be requested again.
	
	Can be used across
		hardware
		OS
		Web browsers
		Applications
		Often found nearest to the front end.
		
	Types of Cache
		Application Server Cache
		Distributed Cache
		Global Cache
		CDN
	Application Server Cache
		Placing cache on request layer node enables local storage.
		But when you've load balancer, it can be send request to any node which increase cache miss.
		Solution
			Distributed Cache
			Global Cache
	Distrubuted Cache
		Each of it's node own part of cached data
		The cache is divided up using a consistent hashing function, such that if a request node is looking for a certain piece of data, it can quickly know where to look within distrubuted cache to check if data is available.
		Increase cache space is easy - add nodes.
	Global Cache
		All nodes using a single cache space.
		Two types of global cache
			When cached response not found in cache 
				1. Cache itself is responsible for retrieving the missing piece of data.
				2. Request node should retrieve the data.
	CDN
		Details to follow
	
Cache Invalidation
	When data is modified at source (say db), cache should be invalidated.
	Types
		Write-through Cache
			Data is written into the cache and db at the same time.
			Adv: Consistency of data.
			Dis adv: Latency (delay)
		Write Around Cache
			Write bypassing the cache.
			Adv: Reduces flooded write on cache.
			Disadv: Chances of consistency issue. Additional step required to solve that.
		Write Back Cache
			Data written to cache and transaction confirmed. Data is synced to storage at specific interval.
			Adv: speed.
			Dis adv: In consistency. Probablity of loosing data. 
###########################################################
8. Hashing
###########################################################
	Transformation of a string of characters 
	into usually shorter fixed-length value or key 
	that represents the original string.
	
	
	used to index and retrieve items in db, objects ect.
	

Hashing
	Hash function : generate a number based on input
	

Some use cases of Hashing
	Used  
		To index data
			Hash and store the data.
			When searched, hash and search for it.
		In cryptographic application
			Plain text communication is risky. 
			Instead hash and communicate over the wire.
		Sharding the keys
			When there are multiple servers and a data need to be available on all of them.
			Distribute the keys.
		Finding duplicate Records

Simple example of Hash function
Hashing function H(x) = x mod 10
	21, 59, 34, 48, 83, 42, 69
	
Where will get stored in a table like below	
	0
	1
	2
	
	https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/hashing

	Uses
	Finding duplicate/similar records as similar records/strings will produce similar hash
	Protecting data as when the data is modified the calculated hash also changes
	Cryptography to check message integrity, data corruption detection, digital signature, authentication, etc…
	Hash tables to quickly locate records
	Message Digest
